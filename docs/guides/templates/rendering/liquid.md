# Templating with Liquid

Liquid is a simple and secure templating language that can be used inside your template.
Internally, Enpage uses the library [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/). Check out [their docs](https://liquidjs.com/docs/) to learn more about the Liquid syntax.


::: warning Note
Due to the nature of Enpage templates and the way they can be edited, Liquid has to be used in a specific way. The following chapters will guide you through simple examples of how to use Liquid in Enpage to make loops, conditions, and filters.
