# Enpage Templates Overview

Templates are the foundation of websites created on the Enpage platform. They are pre-designed layouts that enable users to build a website without any coding.

## Open technologies

Templates are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can include images, fonts, and other assets. They define the layout and design of a website and can be customized to suit the needs of the site owner.

## No specific framework enforced

Templates are not tied to a specific framework or library like React or Vue, so developers and designers have the freedom to use any tools they prefer. Tailwind CSS is recommended for styling, and bundled by default, but can be easily disabled.


## Dynamic templates

One of the unique features of Enpage as a website builder is its ability to use multiple data sources to populate templates. This enables the templates to be dynamic, displaying different content based on the various data sources.

## SEO friendly

Enpage templates are designed to be SEO-friendly, meaning they are optimized for search engines to improve a website's visibility in search results. Even with dynamic data sources, Enpage ensures this optimization by rendering the templates on the server side in production. During template development, or within the Enpage Editor, the templates are partially rendered client-side to facilitate live editing and previewing.
