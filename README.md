# Upstart SDK

The Upstart SDK encompasses the  core functionality for the Upstart templates.
Based on standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), it provides a set of components, utilities, and tools to assist you
in creating templates that are responsive, accessible, and easy to customize and use.

If you want to test the SDK in the template example, you'll also need to run `pnpm dev` in the
`packages/template-example` directory.

### Releasing new versions

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>Can I use the Upstart SDK in a proprietary website?</summary>

While the Upstart SDK is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL),
 users can still build proprietary websites using it. However, there are some key considerations:

1. The AGPL doesn't restrict the use of the library in proprietary websites.
2. If the website simply uses the library without modifying it, there's no obligation to release the website's source code.
3. However, if the website modifies the AGPL-licensed library, those modifications must be made available under the AGPL.
4. The AGPL has a "network use" clause: If the modified library is used to provide a service over a network (like a web application), the source code of the modified library must be made available to users of that service.
5. This doesn't mean the entire website code needs to be open-sourced, just the modifications to the AGPL-licensed library.
